# Django tutorial
A very simple Django project that provides information about states. In this project, I used the ready-made state information api.

## Required Software and Frameworks
Used python 3.10 and Django 4.0
## Getting Started
  - **Installation**
  
    `pip install Django`
  
  - **Start Server**
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  
  **Then the project will run on localhost**
